1.)
    a.) This algorithm is actually pretty effecient (O(n)) because you would only have
    to run a few calculations to get to the end.
    
    b.) Even though this function is very simple and does one thing, with a large number it could
    be bottlenecked because it is an O(n^4) function.
    
    c.) This function will go quickly for small numbers and seem really efficient but getting into
    bigger numbers you will reach a stack limit because of the amount of the recursion calls
